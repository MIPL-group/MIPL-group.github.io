# Course Selection
## Search Options
There are three search options available: 1. Courses 2. Instructors 3. Majors
1. There are only a few websites for each options. In other words, users can only search for certain keywords (Otherwise nothing will be printed out). Those keywords are listed below for each option.
2. Those result websites are totally static without any rendered content. I think those are enough for web scraping tasks.
### Courses
I guess this option is the most useful one when students use such websites. 
The current result websites are only "./course/eesc445.html", "./course/eecs445.html", "./course/eecs482.html" for this option.
So if users click option "Courses", the only keywords that can return valid results are "eecs442", "eecs445" and "eecs482".

### Instructors
The current result websites are only "./instructor/Justin_Johnson.html" for this option. So if users click option "Instructors", the only keyword that can return valid results are "Justin Johnson"

### Majors
The current result websites are only "./major/"
